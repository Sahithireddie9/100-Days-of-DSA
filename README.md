#  100 Days of DSA Challenge

Welcome to my **#100DaysOfDSA** challenge! 
I'm solving one Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problem every day for 100 days and organizing them **pattern-wise** â€” from Sliding Window to Dynamic Programming and beyond.

This repo contains:
- Problem descriptions and my intuition
- Brute force and optimized approaches
- Java code solutions

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Build strong DSA fundamentals
- Practice pattern-based problem solving
- Improve coding speed and accuracy for interviews
- Stay consistent and publicly accountable
- Share knowledge with others
